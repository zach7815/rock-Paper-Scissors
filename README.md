# rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my rendition of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is a simple front end app, that allows players to play against the computer in either one round, three 
rounds or five. It also incoporates some animation to try and represent the action of making rock, paper, scissors gestures with your hands.
